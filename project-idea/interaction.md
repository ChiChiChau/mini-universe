# Interaction

- Black space background with a calm, empty feel.
- Slow, organic motion that is not perfectly parallel.
- Left-click and drag rotates the camera with a fixed orientation.
- Mouse wheel zooms in and out.
- Clicking an object zooms in, and clicking again zooms back out.
- Clickable hitboxes are larger than visible objects, with a second invisible hitbox for easier selection.
