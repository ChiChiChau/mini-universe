# Project Idea

This project explores an interactive visual platform for artists and freelancers. The goal is to express a community network through a calm, space-inspired interface where visitors can discover topics, artists, and their work.

## MVP Implementation Plan

MVP goals:
- Deliver a minimal, calm space scene with basic camera controls.
- Validate interaction feel (drag rotate and wheel zoom).
- Establish placeholders for a black hole and one solar system.

Milestones (M0–M3):
- M0: Scope and assumptions
  - Success criteria: MVP goals agreed; static content assumption recorded.
- M1: Minimal scene + camera
  - Success criteria: black background, central black hole placeholder, one solar system placeholder, drag rotate with fixed orientation, wheel zoom.
- M2: Slow motion + clickability
  - Success criteria: slow, organic motion is visible; objects remain easy to select.
- M3: Selection + zoom-to-object
  - Success criteria: click-to-zoom in/out works consistently.
