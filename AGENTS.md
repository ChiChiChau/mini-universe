# AGENTS.md — Static HTML (GitHub Pages)

## Project
This repository contains a very simple static website.
The website currently consists of a single file: index.html.
It is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Core Rules (very important)
- Work with HTML only.
- Modify or create ONLY index.html.
- Do NOT create or modify CSS files.
- Do NOT create or modify JavaScript files.
- Do NOT use frameworks or generators.

## Entry Point
- The website entry point is index.html located in the repository root.
- If index.html exists, it is the only file that may be changed.

## Workflow
1) Open index.html.
2) Apply the requested changes using plain, readable HTML.
3) Keep changes minimal and focused.
4) Do exactly what is requested — nothing more.

## Definition of Done
A task is complete when:
- index.html contains valid HTML
- the page renders in a browser
- no other files were modified

## Output
- Always create a Pull Request
- Briefly summarize what was changed in index.html
